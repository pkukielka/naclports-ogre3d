<h2>5 Stages of Life - A Tutorial</h2>
<p>This page has quick links to the Google IO 2011 Life tutorial. Click on the
  sample names to run them.</p>

  <dd>This stage of Life shows the basic project layout with the necessary
  files: <code>.nmf</code>, <code>life.html</code> and a simple build system
  based on GNU make.
  <p><code>life.html</code> contains the HTML and Javascript needed to create
  a "full-tab" game.  If you enter the full-screen mode in Chrome, the game
  appears to take the whole screen.  See also <code>life.css</code>
  for more info on the classes used for things like autosizing and filling
  an HTML element.</p>
  <p>The 2D drawing is implemented directly on the UI thread.  In the next
  stage, 2D drawing is moved to an independent thread.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt><a href="life_stage_2/life.html">Stage 2: Meet Your Parents</a></dt>
  <dd>This stage adds event handling by adding Javascript to process mouse
  events into "drag" events.  Whenever a mouse-down or drag event occurs over
  the NaCl module's screen area, the Javascript code calls the
  <code>addCellAtPoint()</code> method on the NaCl module with the mouse
  coordinates.
  </dd>

  Gum</a></dt>
  <dd>The most significant change in this stage of Life is moving the
  simulation and 2D drawing code onto its own thread.  A couple of small
  helper classes are introduced to support threading:
  <code>ScopedMutexLock</code> and <code>ScopedPixelLock</code>.
  <p>Of interest is the code in <code>Life::DidChangeView()</code>, which
  handles size changes by setting some state.  The pixel buffer is actually
  not updated until the next tick of the simulation loop, in
  <code>Update()</code>.  This happens because the pixel buffer passed into
  Pepper that is ultimately flushed to the browser cannot be safely deleted
  until the <code>FlushCallback()</code> completion callback has been called by
  the browser.
