NaCl port of V8 JavaScript Engine (http://code.google.com/p/v8/)

Major V8 modifications:
- Splitting JavaScript Code objects to separate code and meta-data. NaCl does
  not allow data in code segments. In CrankShaft we masquerade some data in the
  code segments with PUSH(immediate) instructions, so that the data appears as
  valid inductions, but these instructions are never executed under normal
  operation of V8.
- Fixing uses of JavaScript Code objects to reflect the separating of code
  and data in these objects.
- Changing allocation and deallocation of the executable memory for the
  JavaScript Code objects. The memory must be provided from a special region
  marked by NaCl for dynamically-loaded code.
- All code insertion/deletion/self-modification is performed via NaCl service
  runtime calls.
- Code emitted by V8 complies with NaCl security constraints (e.g. sandboxing
  of indirect jumps, instruction alignment).
 
Details of NaCl and V8 modifications are in the technical paper (nacljit.pdf)
which appears in 2011 ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and
Implementation.

  V8s.

To run V8 Benchmark Suite for a specific V8
cd <V8's directory, e.g. nacl-v8-ia32-3.1.4>
./run.sh release benchmark

To run SunSpider100 Benchmark Suite for a specific V8
cd <V8's directory, e.g. nacl-v8-ia32-3.1.4>
./run.sh release sunspider
