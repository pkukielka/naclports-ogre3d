 This directory contains headers and stubs needed to compile libraries with
extensive dependencies on Glibc, which couldn't be directly compiled with 
newlib headers.

 Code here is mostly taken from the newlib CVS (trunk from Sep 5 2012), see
http://sourceware.org/newlib/download.html
and is BSD-licensed, so could be linked statically into differently
licensed programs. Some simple placeholders were written from scratch, and also
BSD-style licensed.
